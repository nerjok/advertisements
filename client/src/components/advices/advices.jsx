            Use Short Sentences. Long sentences will not sell your ad, let alone your product. People’s attention span tends to drift fast these days, so don’t bore your readers with long sentences.  Instead, be direct and to the point.

          <li className="list-group-item">
          Use Different Sentence Structures. Do not be afraid to be creative in your writing. Employ different sentence structures within your ad to keep your readers interested. The more varied your presentation is, the less boring your ad becomes.

            Keep Your Ad Short. You don’t have to cram all the information you have into your ad. On the other hand, your ad should make your readers curious and leave them wanting more.  Short ads will accomplish this for you.

            Close With a Statement That Calls Your Reader to Action.If the opening statement needs to catch attention, the closing statement should call your readers to action. It should be written creatively enough so that the readers will be interested to know more about your product and buy it.

          <li className="list-group-item">
            Re-Read and Rewrite as Necessary. After you have written your ad, read it again. Proofread your writing and rewrite as necessary. 
            The proofreading stage is just as important as the writing stage because having errors in your ad easily destroys your credibility.
